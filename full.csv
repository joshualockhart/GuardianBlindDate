To meet someone who I'd enjoy spending time with enough to be able to go on somewhere afterwards, instead of awkwardly parting ways ""as it's a school night"". First impressions?  I was surprised that she was very pretty. What did you talk about?  Living in other countries and everyone speaking English, surfing around the world, Glaswegians, Kronenbourg and Indian cooking. Any awkward moments?  When two friendly ladies sat next to us. They were oblivious to the fact that we'd met only 10 minutes earlier. Good table manners?  Considering that we were eating ribs with our fingers, yes, exceptional. Best thing about Charis?  Fantastically interesting without being arrogant. Would you introduce her to your friends?  Yeah she'd fit in as one of them no problem. Could she meet the parents?  Bit early, but why not?  They might get the wrong impression, though. Did you go on somewhere?

A laugh: no one too serious. First impressions?  Nice guy, easy to talk to. What did you talk about?  A lot – from living abroad to cycling naked. Any awkward moments?  Only when we got served spare ribs. Is there any polite way to eat them?  Good table manners?  Well, we figured there is no polite way to eat spare ribs, so it didn't really matter. Best thing about Matt?  I felt at ease with him. Would you introduce him to your friends?  Happily. Could he meet the parents?  I don't think either of us see our own parents much, so I doubt it. Did you go on somewhere?  We went to a nearby pub. And… did you kiss?  Nah. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?  Maybe my jetlag. I was still a bit out of it.

Travel, sport, career aspirations and our aversion to technology. Any awkward moments?  I think the waiters may have had a bet on when our date would turn to disaster. Good table manners?

No, apart from the fact we probably talked too much, because it took the waiter five attempts before we were ready to order. Good table manners?  No one spilled anything, although I came close to knocking over my wine. Best thing about Nat?  She’s very easy-going. Would you introduce her to your friends?  Definitely.

Oh, and a good ""I once did the Guardian blind date"" anecdote. First impressions?  Good, although I thought he was Irish [rather than Maltese]. He took that well. What did you talk about?  Radio 4, politics, Malta, Edinburgh, West End theatre – lots of stuff. Any awkward moments?  He looked slightly disappointed when I said I didn't like The Archers. Good table manners?

Impeccable, although the starters tested our mettle on the spiciness front. Best thing about him?  He was polite and very smart. Would you introduce him to your friends?  Sure. The more the merrier.

In short, a female version of myself. First impressions?  Very well turned out. What did you talk about?  Careers, my love of money, her love of travel, cycling, siblings. If we met at a party, we might have chatted for 30 seconds. Any awkward moments?  The realisation we had almost nothing in common. Good table manners?  Fine. Best thing about her?  Very sweet and chatty. Would you introduce her to your friends?  Sure, but it would be a brief and unsuccessful meeting. Could she meet the parents?  They'd be delighted because they do get quite lonely. Did you go on somewhere?  There was no point in flogging a dead horse. And… did you kiss?  Not even a peck on the cheek.

Relaxed, friendly looking. Sporting a somewhat premature sporting a Christmas jumper in early November. He revealed he'd just come from the photoshoot and had been trying to force editorial hand as to when the article would be published! What did you talk about?  ""Fluffy"" v ""worthy"" jobs, hobbies, family, the obligatory ""coming out"" stories, my book group's kooky alternative scoring system to marking out of 10. Any awkward moments?  My total inability to choose a wine, which I presume was matched by a suitably panicked facial expression. Good table manners?

The theatre, eclectic tastes in music, the best pubs in Angel. I gave her lots of film suggestions, and she tried to improve my poor knowledge of music. Any awkward moments?  As the meal was complimentary, trying to work out if we had to ask for the bill – so as not to look like we were doing a runner when we left – was a little awkward. Good table manners?  Pretty good, apart from some teeth on cutlery. Best thing about her?  Her directness, which I found quite charming. Would you introduce her to your friends?  Definitely.

Yes, and eventually even found somewhere that was actually open on a Sunday night, and was bizarrely having happy hour. And... did you kiss?

I was more concerned about him still being there – I was temporarily locked in a courtyard next to the bar. What did you talk about?  Brighton vs Hove, trains, dodgy landlords, football, uni, nipple tassels. Any awkward moments?  Three: he asked if I owned a corset within 10 minutes (not that awkward); he began describing his stag do, then said he meant his brother's – I'm still unsure what to believe; by the end of the date, we both knew there was no chemistry, but I didn't know what to say when he suggested we ""call a spade a spade and leave it at tonight"".

Art, music, children, our homes, professional lives, cooking, Borough market. We found a huge amount in common, even a common acquaintance. Any awkward moments?  None at all. Good table manners?  Yes, perfect. Best thing about her?  Light-hearted, easy smile, laughed at my jokes. Did you go on somewhere?  No. We left very late, though. I put her in a taxi, then caught the last train home. Marks out of 10?  Highly enjoyable, so at least 9 out of 10, if not full marks. Would you meet again?  Yes, already agreed. ","First impressions Personable. Pristine. What did you talk about?  How men make lives for themselves. Londoners at night. Edited back stories. Any awkward moments?  No, although I think it was hard for him to talk about his personal past. Good table manners?  Impeccable. Best thing about him?  He seemed to feel no need to impress. Did you go on somewhere?  Certainly not. I am an old bat. Marks out of 10?  I find that meaningless. But for your purposes, high. Would you meet again?  We will.

Food and chefs, family ties to Cornwall. Any awkward moments?  He made some slightly resentful remarks about where I grew up and where I live, which made me feel uncomfortable. Good table manners?  Yes, although he wasn't assertive about ordering. Best thing about him?  We could chat easily. Did you go on somewhere?  Yes, for a quick drink in a pub. Marks out of 10?  7. Would you meet again?

I was out of my depth with the restaurant, so Kate gave me an education in food. Any awkward moments?  After dinner, in the pub, she didn't seem that happy. Good table manners?  Impeccable. Best thing about her?  A classy lady, it's too difficult to pick one thing. Did you go on somewhere?  Yes, to the Ten Bells in Shoreditch, which I like because it has character, but she wasn't impressed. She got chatted up by another bloke, too, but even being showered with attention didn't cheer her up. Marks out of 10?  7. Would you meet again?  She didn't seem that interested, so I doubt it. • Kate and Ben ate at 1901@Andaz, London EC2, 020-7961 1234 • "," 1901@Andaz, London EC2",7,7,0,1,Straight,f,n

No complaints. Best thing about him?  Chatty, upbeat. Did you go on somewhere?  I broke my foot the week before, so wasn't really up for a big night out. Marks out of 10?  7. Would you meet again?

No. The meal lasted three hours, so we were pretty sleepy. Marks out of 10?  8. Would you meet again?  Yes. It would be interesting to be in our own environment, where we could have a bit more craic.
